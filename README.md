# Machine Learning Application: Predicting Wine Quality

Machine learning is an application of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Furthermore, it has proven valuable because it can solve problems at a speed and scale that cannot be duplicated by the human mind alone. With massive amounts of computational ability behind a single task or multiple specific tasks, machines can be trained to identify patterns in and relationships between input data and automate routine processes. 

For this project, I used Kaggle‚Äôs 'Red Wine Quality' dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is ‚Äúgood" or "bad" quality. Each wine in this dataset is given a ‚Äúquality‚Äù score between 0 and 8. The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

    1) Fixed acidity
    2) Volatile acidity
    3) Citric acid
    4) Residual sugar
    5) Chlorides
    6) Free sulfur dioxide
    7) Total sulfur dioxide
    8) Density
    9) pH
    10) Sulfates
    11) Alcohol

Classification algorithms in machine learning use input training data to predict the likelihood that subsequent data will fall into one of the predetermined categories.

Therefore, the main aim of this project is to experiment with different classification methods and determine which one yields the highest accuracy rate.

## New Digital Age

‚ÄúUnprecedented and simultaneous advances in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics,
the internet of things, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, quantum computing and others are
redefining industries, blurring traditional boundaries, and creating new opportunities. We have dubbed this the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and it is fundamentally
changing the way we live, work and relate to one another.‚Äù
‚ÄîProfessor Klaus Schwab, 2016

It is common practice to prototype concepts in a language such as
Python, then port the solution over to Java or C++ for deployment. Another
recent development is the availability of cloud-based Machine-Learning-asa-Service platforms that include:

    ‚Ä¢ Amazon Machine Learning
    ‚Ä¢ DataRobot
    ‚Ä¢ Google Prediction
    ‚Ä¢ IBM Watson, and
    ‚Ä¢ Microsoft Azure Machine Learning.

Here is a list of languages commonly used in machine
learning:

    ‚Ä¢ Python
    ‚Ä¢ MATLAB/Octave
    ‚Ä¢ R
    ‚Ä¢ Java/Scala
    ‚Ä¢ C/C++
    ‚Ä¢ Julia, and
    ‚Ä¢ Go.

One of the core technologies driving the 4th industrial revolution is
machine learning.
